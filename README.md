# PictureSlideShow
Behaves like Windows Photo Viewer with the option to have a slideshow play in-window.

At this point you might be wondering what kind of attachment I have to viewing local images. That is a good question...

This application allows you to quickly play a slideshow of images in a folder.
Unlike some others, you can set the interval as low as .5s and is done in the window.

Hover the cursor over the window to see the controls. Noteworthy keybindings are:
<ul>
  <li>"Spacebar" : Toggle play</li>
  <li>"Home" : Change folder</li>
  <li>"S" : Shuffle image order</li>
  <li>Left/Right "Arrow" : Previous/Next Image</li>
  <li>"Plus"/"Minus" : Speed up/Slow down slideshow speed by 100ms</li>
</ul>
